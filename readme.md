# decode-binary bot for reddit

The code for a reddit bot that decodes binary. I did this as a noob project to familiarize myself with `snoowrap` and `snoostorm`, nodejs wrappers for the Reddit API. The code is simple enough to be used as a boilerplate for writing Reddit bots in nodejs.

## Note

A `.env` file with configuration variables is required in the root of the project.
